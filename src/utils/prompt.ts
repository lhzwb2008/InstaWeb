User's requirement description: "${description}"

CURRENT PHASE: PLAN

In this phase, you need to:
1. Analyze the user's requirements
2. Determine the main functions and components of the WebApp
3. Design the page structure and user interface
4. Determine the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files

First, provide a brief analysis of the requirements. Then, propose 3-5 key questions to better understand the user's needs. These questions should help clarify any ambiguities and gather additional details needed for implementation.

Output format:
1. Requirements Analysis: [Brief analysis of user requirements]
2. Key Questions: [List 3-5 specific questions to gather more details]`;

User's requirement description: "${description}"

User's additional information:
${answersText}

CURRENT PHASE: PLAN FINALIZATION

Based on the user's description and answers, create a detailed implementation plan for the WebApp. This plan will be used to generate the actual code in the next phase.

Output format:
1. Requirements Summary: [Summarize the user's requirements and answers]
2. Feature List: [List the main features of the WebApp]
3. Page Structure: [Describe the page structure and components]
4. File Structure: [List the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files]

Here is the plan generated in the planning phase:

${JSON.stringify(planData, null, 2)}

CURRENT PHASE: ACT

In this phase, you need to:
1. Generate all necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
2. Ensure the code is high quality, well-structured, and follows best practices
3. Add appropriate comments to explain the code
4. Ensure the WebApp is fully functional and can run directly in a browser

Output format:
1. File Structure: [List all files to be generated]
2. File Content: [For each file, provide the complete code]

For HTML files, use \`\`\`html format.
For CSS files, use \`\`\`css format.
For JavaScript files, use \`\`\`js format.

Make sure to generate complete, functional code that can run directly in a browser without any additional dependencies or build steps.`;
